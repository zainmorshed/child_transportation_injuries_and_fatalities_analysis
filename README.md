Summary: In this role, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of active transportation injuries and fatalities to children in Houston from 2018-2023, 
totaling 629 incidents, 454 of which had geospatial data allowing us to find the location of the incident. I Identified significant demographic trends,
including the overrepresentation of Black children in injury and fatality statistics being 39% compared to their proportion in the general population which made up 22%.
I then employed data visualization techniques including heatmaps, bar charts, line charts, box plots, to explore relationships between variables such as age, ethnicity, gender, and accident severity. 
I also applied unsupervised machine learning (k-means clustering) by assigning 454 data points to the nearest centroid based on the euclidean distance, 
minimizing inertia and providing incident hotspots based on geospatial data. 
This allowed me to quantify my findings into a research paper and identify locations with a high social vulnerability index to offer actionable insights 
for policymakers and stakeholders aiming to enhance child safety and mobility in Houston.
